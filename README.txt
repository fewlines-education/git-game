PART 4

Hi again, there was another timeline problem: some parts of what I want to tell you have been set in another universe.
I need you to "rebase" this universe with ours. The past messages went to the branch earth2

Ok, where am I and where are you?
Oh shoot, I'm in another universe aren't I?

Well I will try to send you information anyway.
It will be hidden inside a lot of junk but I hope you will be able to decipher it anyway.

So... Yeah, it's really inside a big ball of mud but it have been scattered across two universes.
You will need to look at the differences between what you've received inside the file bottle.txt
and the branch earth_42. You can always check the difference between one of your files and another version
in another branch, you just need to use the command: git diff another_branch your_file.
The  --word-diff option will help see more clearly (the option must be set between `git diff` and the rest of the
command).
